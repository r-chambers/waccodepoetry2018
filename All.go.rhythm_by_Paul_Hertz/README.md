This is "All.go.rhythm" by Paul Hertz. His twitter is here: https://twitter.com/ignotus_mago. This poem is from here: https://twitter.com/ignotus_mago/status/392183126190850048. It was submitted to the 2013 Stanford University Code Poetry Slam. 

This is not a poem that's meant to run--I'm not even entirely sure what language it is. It's more psuedo-code or an interpreted language than anything. 

Still, it uses common programming syntax, concepts, and conventions--such as loops, functions, and recursion--to tell a story in a few elegant lines of code poetry. What do you think this code poem would do if it was real code? What do you think it _does_ right now?
