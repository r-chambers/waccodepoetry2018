This is "Python Recipe" by Damian Perniewicz. I found it here: http://code.activestate.com/recipes/496781-romantic-love-poem-in-python/.

It is described by the author as a "Romantic Love Poem in Python"--and it sure is romantic, at least to me! It's just so sweet and adorable, it makes my heart melt. 

I'm also interested in its clever use of syntax and notation--I love how the comments mix with the code to create new messages, and I love the way functions are used to represent the action of love in a relationship.

And, of course, there are these wonderful comments from the author: "This recipe must be used in the proper person state. Implementation of 'love' function is user-dependent. Is demanded that person objects must have compatible interfaces."
