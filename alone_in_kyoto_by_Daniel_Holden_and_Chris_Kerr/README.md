This is "alone_in_kyoto" by Daniel Holden and Chris Kerr. It is created with Haskell. I found it here: http://code-poetry.com.

This poem is actually part of a larger collection of code poetry by the authors, published in the anthology _.code --poetry_ available here: https://www.amazon.co.uk/code--poetry-Mr-Daniel-Holden/dp/1539005232. They have graciously made all their poems available for free online, but there's nothing like holding a book of beautifully crafted code poetry in your hands!

I really, really love this poem, because it just so well-done on every level. the code itself may look messy, but it's very elegant. WLike "Me and You," both the source and output contribute to the poem.
