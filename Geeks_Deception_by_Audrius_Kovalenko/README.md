This is "Geek's Deception" by Audrius Kovalenko. I found it here: http://www.sourcecodepoetry.com.

This is another piece that doesn't care so much about the output--although it does compile! (I was able to compile it in online C# compilers with one minor change: I made Main() a public function.)

Similar to "All.go.rhythm," this uses programming conventions to tell a story. This time it's humorous, with rhythym and rhyme reigning supreme.
