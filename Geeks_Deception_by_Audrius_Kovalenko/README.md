This is "Geek's Deception" by Audrius Kovalenko. I found it here: http://www.sourcecodepoetry.com.

This is another piece that doesn't care so much about the output--although it does compile perfectly fine (with a few warnings, of course) it produces absolutely nothing! Nothing except some laughs. ;) 

(NOTE: In a few online compilers, I needed to make Main() a public function before it would succeed.)

Similar to "All.go.rhythm," this uses programming conventions to tell a story. This time it's humorous, with rhythym and rhyme reigning supreme.
