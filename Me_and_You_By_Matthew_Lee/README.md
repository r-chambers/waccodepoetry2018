This is "Me and You" by Matthew Lee. It was submitted to the 2014 Stanford University Code Poetry Slam. 
I found it here: http://www.melissakagen.com/CPS1.1.2.pdf 

**NOTE:** I have edited this poem from its original form. I have added parenthesis around the print statements so that it is compatible with Python 3. Other than that, I have not changed anything.

To run this poem, go to this online Python interpretor: https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_python_interpreter. Paste in the code, and then click the green RUN button at the top left. See what it does!
